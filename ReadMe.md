## Abstract
---
Current repo checks the connection in a circuit. Given query, we will use trained retrieval model in models/ to find related entry in corpus database (output_extracted_data.xlsx) and get the method to do connection checking and get method to do image grounding. The connection checking methods are under methods/*.py

## Method 

Constructgraph -> find net connection on graph using graph -> 

Graph construction & graph method: the graph method is defined in SIPI/graph.py
